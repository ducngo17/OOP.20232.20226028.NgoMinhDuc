- What are the advantages of Polymorphism
    + Code Reusability
    + Improving readability, maintainability, efficiency of code
    + Reducing the coupling between different functionalities
    + The ability to hide different implementations under a single interface

- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
    Inheritance allows us to inherit attributes and methods from another class, and Polymorphism uses those methods to perform 
different tasks. Inheritance allows subclasses to override methods defined in their superclasses.
- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java? 
    + Inheritance explains the action of inheriting another class. Polymorphism explains what objects gain if objects have a superclass.
    + Inheritance is one in which a new class is created (derived class) that inherits the features from the already existing class(Base class).
    Whereas polymorphism is that which can be defined in multiple forms.
    + It is basically applied to classes. Whereas it is basically applied to functions or methods.
    + Inheritance supports the concept of reusability and reduces code length in object-oriented programming.
    Polymorphism allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time (overloading) as well as run-time (overriding).
